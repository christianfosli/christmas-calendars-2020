I'm mostly doing these in fsharp, to get familiar with fsharp.

`.fsx` files are fsharp interactive files.
Run them with `dotnet fsi <filename>`.
This requires the dotnet sdk.

I'll include a Dockerfile when I'm using features that require dotnet 5,
since that sdk isn't available yet for many linux distros (including the one I'm
using... :smile: )
